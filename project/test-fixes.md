# Data Fix Verification Guide

## Issues Fixed

1. **Delivered orders not showing in customer dues**
   - Fixed order status update to create ledger entries when orders are delivered
   - Added customer outstanding amount update when orders are delivered
   - Added reversal logic when order status changes from delivered to something else

2. **Ledger entries showing for all customers**
   - Fixed ledger API to properly filter by customer for customer role
   - Ensured customer-specific data is shown correctly

3. **Customer transaction history not showing only their data**
   - Updated account statement to use ledger entries instead of separate orders/collections
   - Fixed data fetching to show only customer-specific transactions

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Test Delivered Orders in Customer Dues

1. Create a new order for a customer
2. Change the order status to "delivered"
3. Check the customer's outstanding amount - it should increase by the order amount
4. Check the ledger entries - there should be a new "order" type entry
5. Change the order status back to "pending" - the outstanding amount should decrease

### 2. Test Customer-Specific Ledger Data

1. Login as a customer
2. Go to Account Statement
3. Verify only their transactions are shown
4. Check that the running balance is calculated correctly

### 3. Test Admin Ledger Management

1. Login as admin
2. Go to Customer Ledger
3. Select a specific customer
4. Verify only that customer's entries are shown
5. Use the data fix utilities to sync data

## Data Fix Utilities

The admin dashboard now includes three utility buttons:

1. **Recalculate Outstanding** - Recalculates customer outstanding amounts based on delivered orders and cleared collections
2. **Sync Ledger with Orders** - Creates ledger entries for delivered orders and removes entries for non-delivered orders
3. **Recalculate from Ledger** - Recalculates outstanding amounts based on ledger entries

## API Endpoints Added

- `POST /api/ledger/recalculate-outstanding` - Recalculate outstanding amounts
- `POST /api/ledger/sync-ledger-with-orders` - Sync ledger with delivered orders
- `POST /api/ledger/recalculate-outstanding-from-ledger` - Recalculate from ledger entries

## Expected Behavior

After applying these fixes:

1. When an order is delivered, it should:
   - Create a ledger entry with type "order"
   - Update the customer's outstanding amount
   - Show up in the customer's account statement

2. Customer account statements should:
   - Show only their own transactions
   - Display correct running balances
   - Include delivered orders as debits

3. Admin ledger management should:
   - Allow filtering by customer
   - Show all entries when "All Customers" is selected
   - Display correct running balances

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Run the "Sync Ledger with Orders" utility to ensure all delivered orders have ledger entries
2. Run the "Recalculate Outstanding" utility to fix customer outstanding amounts
3. Check the browser console for any API errors
4. Verify the database has the correct data by checking the MongoDB collections directly
